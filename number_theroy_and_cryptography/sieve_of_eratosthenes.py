Create a boolean array "prime[0..n]" 

and initialize all entries it as true.

A value in prime[i] will finally be false 

if i is Not a prime, else true.

Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by the Eratostheneâ€™s method: 
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime.

Explanation with Example: 

Let us take an example when n = 50. So we need to print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 50. 

We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 50.

According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.

Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.  

We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.  

We continue this process

So the prime numbers are the unmarked ones: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.
